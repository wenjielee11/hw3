            <img src="https://www.wenjielee.tech/_next/image?url=%2FBiophoto.jpg&w=1080&q=75" alt="Picture of Wen Jie Lee" class="img-fluid my-2"/>
            <p>
                My name is <strong>Wen Jie Lee</strong> and I am currently a senior studying at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My major is Computer Science. 
                I speak 3 languages: English, Mandarin, and Bahasa Malaysia. I am originally from Malaysia, but I currently reside in <em>localhost:Wisconsin-Madison</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Raised in Malaysia, I consider myself fortunate to have been able to support and uplift those in need from a young age. My high school years were marked by significant involvement in volunteer work and leadership roles within various organizations. 
                As the Divisional Chairman of St. John's Ambulance Malaysia, I led healthcare-focused initiatives, including charity drives, donation campaigns, first-aid duties and classes, and footdrill, among others. In my role as Vice President of the IT club, I organized Java programming lessons, which further honed my programming skills through extensive practice in extracurricular activities. I was also the President of the Badminton Club, where I oversaw club operations, funds, and biweekly curriculum to train athletes who later got second place in our state-level badminton competitions!
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up, my parents were pretty hands-off on how I should live: To live for others, or to live for your own. At the age of 15, they told me that they had taught me everything there is, and that I should search for my own faith, for my own life, and for my own system. It was honestly a difficult conversation for me, finding myself in a universe of opportunities so broad, so vast and vague.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had once read a short story written by Yvonne Vera, a famous Zimbabwean author skilled in describing surrealism and gender fluidity. Stealing and paraphrasing one of her quotes:
                <em>"You could at one point be the boy who became everything, and at the same time be the boy who embraced nothingness."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                -- In this universe, it was up to me to decide on what I wanted to be. And so I tried, I worked, and I failed. I threw myself into extracurriculars hoping I could find my answer. 
                I built my division, my organizations, I made tons of friends that I cherished to my heart--
            </p>
            <p>
                But it wasn't enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                I needed a platform with a much larger influence. Medicine wasn't for me: There were only so many people I could save with a pair of hands. There were also only so many people I could reach out to within a classroom. After my journey of trial and error in a multitude of fields, I decided on Computer Science. 
                With a flick of a finger, software deployed could instantly reach millions of people at once. My journey to fulfillment could have a substantial meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coming to Wisconsin-Madison, I have been looking for an employer that could fulfill my aspirations. It isn't just a platform to fork a bitstream of endless money, but something for me to find purpose in.
            </p>
            <p>
                To me, at the end of the line, life has so much more meaning when you are leaving behind a legacy. Be it a child, your loved ones, your possessions, your world, and your universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                And thus here I am, hoping to impress you with everything that I have made and am making in my programming journey. To live is to die, and before death, is to leave a mark.
            </p>
            <p><strong>But enough about me. What about you, who are you to become?</strong></p>
